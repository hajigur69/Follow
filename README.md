# GithubFollow - Follow By Target List

This project allows you to **manage your GitHub following list efficiently by targeting specific user lists**. You can follow or unfollow users based on a target list, such as followers of a particular account or users not following you back.

## Features

- Follow specific users from a target list

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hajigur69/GithubFollow.git
   cd GithubFollow
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
    python f.py followers.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script or web app (if applicable) to interact with the GitHub API and manage your following list.

Example command to follow all followers of a target user:

```bash
python f.py --target username --action follow
```

## How It Works

The tool uses the GitHub API to fetch followers or following lists of a target user, compares them with your own following list, and performs follow actions accordingly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate scopes (e.g., `user:follow`)
